Original Notes:

ip “192.168.0.128”

to we're going to expllore the metasploit server

first thing I notice is that Metasploit2 do not have a lockout/timeout for it's server when running. the server never locks the user out

another issue, metasploitable2 runs as admin

if we enter hte ip into the browser we get a website

website info:

    WebDAV

phpadmin requires a password, msfadmin doesn't work

we also have dwva (found on the metasploitable2 website)

this means we have a lot of sub sites we can find
furthermore, we can log into dwva (damn vuln web app) that we can learn and exploit! How usefule:D

so we have MANY many ways to exploit this.

We decided to utilize port 21 and vsftpd 2.3.4 which as exploits when we look at metaploitable

so, we have lots of options here, but let's do the direct thing and go for the server

so when we use metaplosit with vsftpd 2.3.4 we set the rhost as teh target of 192.168.0.128 and local host (lhost) of 192.168.0.231 and utilize the 2.3.4 exploit and we get a shell instantly - found the flag under the msfadmin dir

we use sudo -l and see that we have root access

Now hte hard part, fixing the issue via blue team.
