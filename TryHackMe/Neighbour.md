Orginal Notes:
Rating: Easy

Honestly, first impressions arent great. The UI is easy to understand, but the slow connections, errors that required a restart, and overall wait times kill any sense of urgency and the ability to feel like I'm diving into the work. I know it's the free area, but not a great way to introduce people to the system and get them hooked. The attack box froze numerous times even trying to open a single program or web browser.

I tried again later. Honestly. What should have been a 5 minute lesson took over half an hour due to lag and poor performance from their site.


Steps:
1) once the page loaded, we see a login screen with a command of ctrl+u to find the guest login - I orginally was going to try dirb, but this box does not have that tool available
2) when the source page is open we see a comment that the guest count is guest / guest <img width="473" height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02c67112-a669-4545-abdb-2607786ae884" />
3) When the page loads we notice the word guest in the url for our name and we view the source again.
4) In the source we see admin is broke and we enter it into the url
5) The flag is there

Room Rating 1/5 stars simply due to the terrible experience
